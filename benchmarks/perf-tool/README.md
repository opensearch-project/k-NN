## Welcome!

This directory contains the code related to benchmarking the k-NN plugin. 
Benchmarks can be run against any OpenSearch cluster with the k-NN plugin 
installed. Benchmarks are highly configurable using the test configuration 
file.

## Install Prerequisites

### Python

Python 3.7 or above is required.

### Pip

Use pip to install the necessary requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

In order to run a benchmark, you must first create a test configuration yml 
file. Checkout [this example](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/blob/main/benchmarks/perf-tool/sample-configs) file 
for benchmarking *faiss*'s IVF method. This file contains the definition for 
the benchmark that you want to run. At the top are 
[test parameters](#test-parameters). These define high level settings of the 
test, such as the endpoint of the OpenSearch cluster. 

Next, you define the actions that the test will perform. These actions are 
referred to as steps. First, you can define "setup" steps. These are steps that 
are run once at the beginning of the execution to configure the cluster how you 
want it. These steps do not contribute to the final metrics.

After that, you define the "steps". These are the steps that the test will be 
collecting metrics on. Each step emits certain metrics. These are run 
multiple times, depending on the test parameter "num_runs". At the end of the 
execution of all of the runs, the metrics from each run are collected and 
averaged.

Lastly, you define the "cleanup" steps. The "cleanup" steps are executed after 
each test run. For instance, if you are measuring index performance, you may 
want to delete the index after each run.

To run the test, execute the following command:
```
python knn-perf-tool.py [--log LOGLEVEL] test config-path.yml output.json

--log       log level of tool, options are: info, debug, warning, error, critical
```

The output will be a json document containing the results.

Additionally, you can get the difference between two test runs using the diff 
command:
```
python knn-perf-tool.py [--log LOGLEVEL] diff result1.json result2.json

--log       log level of tool, options are: info, debug, warning, error, critical
```

The output will be the delta between the two metrics.

### Data sets

This benchmark tool uses pre-generated data sets to run indexing and query workload. For some benchmark types existing dataset need to be 
extended. Filtering is an example of use case where such dataset extension is needed.

It's possible to use script provided with this repo to generate dataset and run benchmark for filtering queries.
You need to have existing dataset with vector data. This dataset will be used  to generate additional attribute data and set of ground truth neighbours document ids.

To generate dataset with attributes based on vectors only dataset use following command pattern:

```commandline
python add-filters-to-dataset.py <path_to_dataset_with_vectors> <path_of_new_dataset_with_attributes> True False
```

To generate neighbours dataset for different filters based on dataset with attributes use following command pattern:

```commandline
python add-filters-to-dataset.py <path_to_dataset_with_vectors> <path_of_new_dataset_with_attributes> False True
```

After that new dataset(s) can be referred from testcase definition in `ingest_extended` and `query_with_filter` steps.
