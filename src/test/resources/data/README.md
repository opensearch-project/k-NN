# test_vectors_binary_1000x128.json
The file contains a simulated data to represent binary vector. The data is generated by quantizing data from
test_vectors_1000x128.json and packing 8 bits to 1 byte which ends up with 16 length of vector per document.
For quantization technique, we calculated the median(49935.95941056451) of all values and converted it as 0 
if it is less than the median and 1 if it is equal to or larger than the median.

# test_queries_binary_100x128.csv
The file contains a simulated query data in binary vector format. The data is generated by quantizing data from
test_queries_100x128.csv and packing 8 bits to 1 byte with ends up with 16 length of vector per query.
For quantization technique, we calculated the median(49935.95941056451) of all values in test_vectors_1000x128.json
and converted it as 0 if it is less than the median and 1 if it is equal to or larger than the median.

# test_vectors_nested_1000x128.json
The file contains a simulated data to represent nested field.
Consecutive ids are assigned for data from same parent document.
For example, let's say there are ids of 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12.
Then, the 2, 3, 4, 5 are ids of nested field in parent document with id 6 and 10, 11, 12 are ids of nested field 
in parent document with id 13.
