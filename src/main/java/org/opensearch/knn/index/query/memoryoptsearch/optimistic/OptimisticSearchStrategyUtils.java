/**
 * Utility class providing helper methods for the optimistic search strategy used in KNN search.
 *
 * <p>The optimistic search strategy executes a two-phase KNN search across multiple index segments:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Phase 1 – Shallow search:</b> Runs an approximate KNN search independently on each
 *       segment with an adjusted <code>k</code> value based on segment size. The results are merged
 *       into a single candidate list across all segments.</li>
 *   <li><b>Phase 2 – Deep search:</b> Selects only the segments whose minimum score is greater than
 *       or equal to the <code>k</code>-th largest score from the merged results of Phase&nbsp;1, and
 *       re-runs a refined KNN search using the collected candidates as seeds.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This class provides utility functions that assist in merging results, computing score thresholds,
 * and managing per-segment results between the two phases.
 *
 * <p>All methods are static and stateless.
