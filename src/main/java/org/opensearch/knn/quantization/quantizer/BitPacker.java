     * Quantizes a given floating-point vector and packs the resulting quantized bits into a provided byte array.
     * This method operates by comparing each element of the input vector against corresponding thresholds
     * and encoding the results into a compact binary format using the specified number of bits per coordinate.
     *
     * <p>
     * The method supports multi-bit quantization where each coordinate of the input vector can be represented
     * by multiple bits. For example, with 2-bit quantization, each coordinate is encoded into 2 bits, allowing
     * for four distinct levels of quantization per coordinate.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Consider a vector with 3 coordinates: <code>[1.2, 3.4, 5.6]</code> and thresholds:
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     * thresholds = {
     *     {1.0, 3.0, 5.0},  // First bit thresholds
     *     {1.5, 3.5, 5.5}   // Second bit thresholds
     * };
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * If the number of bits per coordinate is 2, the quantization process will proceed as follows:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>First bit comparison:
     *         <ul>
     *             <li>1.2 > 1.0 -> 1</li>
     *             <li>3.4 > 3.0 -> 1</li>
     *             <li>5.6 > 5.0 -> 1</li>
     *         </ul>
     *     </li>
     *     <li>Second bit comparison:
     *         <ul>
     *             <li>1.2 <= 1.5 -> 0</li>
     *             <li>3.4 <= 3.5 -> 0</li>
     *             <li>5.6 > 5.5 -> 1</li>
     *         </ul>
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The resulting quantized bits will be <code>11 10 11</code>, which is packed into the provided byte array.
     * If there are fewer than 8 bits, the remaining bits in the byte are set to 0.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Packing Process:</b>
     * The quantized bits are packed into the byte array. The first coordinate's bits are stored in the most
     * significant positions of the first byte, followed by the second coordinate, and so on. In the example
     * above, the resulting byte array will have the following binary representation:
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     * packedBits = [11011000] // Only the first 6 bits are used, and the last two are set to 0.
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p><b>Bitwise Operations Explanation:</b></p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li><b>byteIndex:</b> This is calculated using <code>byteIndex = bitPosition >> 3</code>, which is equivalent to <code>bitPosition / 8</code>. It determines which byte in the byte array the current bit should be placed in.</li>
     *     <li><b>bitIndex:</b> This is calculated using <code>bitIndex = 7 - (bitPosition & 7)</code>, which is equivalent to <code>7 - (bitPosition % 8)</code>. It determines the exact bit position within the byte.</li>
     *     <li><b>Setting the bit:</b> The bit is set using <code>packedBits[byteIndex] |= (1 << bitIndex)</code>. This shifts a 1 into the correct bit position and ORs it with the existing byte value to set the bit.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param vector             the floating-point vector to be quantized.
     * @param thresholds         a 2D array representing the quantization thresholds. The first dimension corresponds to the number of bits per coordinate, and the second dimension corresponds to the vector's length.
     * @param bitsPerCoordinate  the number of bits used per coordinate, determining the granularity of the quantization.
     * @param packedBits         the byte array where the quantized bits will be packed.
