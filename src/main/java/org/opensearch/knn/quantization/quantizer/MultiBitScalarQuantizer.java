/**
 * MultiBitScalarQuantizer is responsible for quantizing vectors into multi-bit representations per dimension.
 * Unlike the OneBitScalarQuantizer, which uses a single bit per dimension to represent whether a value is above
 * or below a mean threshold, the MultiBitScalarQuantizer allows for multiple bits per dimension, enabling more
 * granular and precise quantization.
 *
 * <p>
 * In a OneBitScalarQuantizer, each dimension of a vector is compared to a single threshold (the mean), and a single
 * bit is used to indicate whether the value is above or below that threshold. This results in a very coarse
 * representation where each dimension is either "on" or "off."
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The MultiBitScalarQuantizer, on the other hand, uses multiple thresholds per dimension. For example, in a 2-bit
 * quantization scheme, three thresholds are used to divide each dimension into four possible regions. Each region
 * is represented by a unique 2-bit value. This allows for a much finer representation of the data, capturing more
 * nuances in the variation of each dimension.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The thresholds in MultiBitScalarQuantizer are calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the sampled
 * vectors for each dimension. Here's how it works:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>First, the mean and standard deviation are computed for each dimension across the sampled vectors.</li>
 *     <li>For each bit used in the quantization (e.g., 2 bits per coordinate), the thresholds are calculated
 *         using a linear combination of the mean and the standard deviation. The combination coefficients are
 *         determined by the number of bits, allowing the thresholds to split the data into equal probability regions.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>For example, in a 2-bit quantization (which divides data into four regions), the thresholds might be
 *         set at points corresponding to -1 standard deviation, 0 standard deviations (mean), and +1 standard deviation.
 *         This ensures that the data is evenly split into four regions, each represented by a 2-bit value.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The number of bits per coordinate is determined by the type of scalar quantization being applied, such as 2-bit
 * or 4-bit quantization. The increased number of bits per coordinate in MultiBitScalarQuantizer allows for better
 * preservation of information during the quantization process, making it more suitable for tasks where precision
 * is crucial. However, this comes at the cost of increased storage and computational complexity compared to the
 * simpler OneBitScalarQuantizer.
 * </p>
