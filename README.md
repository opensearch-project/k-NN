## Welcome!

**OpenSearch k-NN** enables you to run the nearest neighbor search on billions of documents across thousands of dimensions with the same ease as running any regular OpenSearch query. You can use aggregations and filter clauses to further refine your similarity search operations. k-NN similarity search powers use cases such as product recommendations, fraud detection, image and video search, related document search, and more.
